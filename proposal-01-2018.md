#Outline Document Draft

##What you can expect at code club
Learn the basics of programming through completing challenges
Types of challenge
How many challenges we have for you to complete
Code club online material 
Working speed and not completing a challenge


##What we expect from you at code club
To learn by getting things right or wrong
To have fun without disrupting others
To share your personal additions towards the end if time
To put in the effort to complete the challenges, or ask for help


If coding seems too hard for you, that can be changed
    Maybe you are not breaking down the problem far enough
    Maybe you are afraid of making a mistake and being seen as 'dumb'
    Maybe you don't understand the problem well enough to solve it

##The Programmer mindset
Don't be afraid of doing the obvious first, a better method may come later
Plan your code ahead of time (or read through the problem sheet once before beginning)
Learn to break problem tasks down into easy steps
    If the step is too hard break it down further
    If that step is too hard, ask someone else (teacher or search engine)
You will forget things, take notes in a small notebook to jog your memory
You have permission to be curious and learn anything
Don't be afraid to write 'bad' code, just write however you like
    what matters is that it works.
If you want to know more about programming, ask look for what others have done
Try searching the web, things like "how to become a programmer", quora will have good answers
The internet has almost unlimited free resources to learn from
